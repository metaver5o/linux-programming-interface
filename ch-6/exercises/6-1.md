# 6-1
Compile the program in Listing 6-1 (mem_segments.c), and list its size
using ls â€“l. Although the program contains an array (mbuf) that is around 10 MB
in size, the executable file is much smaller than this. Why is this?

This _should_ be because the array `mbuf` is on the stack, which is part
of the process address space. When the program reaches that line in the code, the
stack pointer should be subtracted so that `mbuf` points at a 10MB region of stack space.
