# linux-programming-interface
Reading notes from Kerrisk's "The Linux Programming Interface" for the
[Bradfield School of Computer Science reading group]() based on the text.

## Dockerized workspace
This repo comes with a Dockerized workspace so I (and others) can on exercises
on non Linux machines. See the Makefile for automation around using this container.
If this is your first time using the container, run `make workspace` to begin using it.
